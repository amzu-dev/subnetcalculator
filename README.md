## Subnet Calculator

### A subnet calculator for IPv4 addresses built using the [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Netmask](https://github.com/rs/node-netmask) libraries.

I would like to add IPv6 support in the future. This will require a new ip address library since [Netmask](https://github.com/rs/node-netmask) does not support IPv6. The [ip](https://github.com/indutny/node-ip) library looks like the best option.
